What's whispered in your ear, proclaim with might.

[Verse 1]
Twelve disciples given power and name,
To heal the sick and drive out shame,
"Go to the lost sheep of Israel's fold,
Proclaim the kingdom, be brave and bold.
Freely you've received, now freely give,
Show them how the risen King wants them to live."

[Chorus]
I send you out as sheep among wolves tonight,
Be wise as serpents, gentle as doves in flight,
Don't fear those who kill the body alone,
Fear Him who judges—before His throne.

[Verse 2]
They'll drag you before governors and kings,
But the Spirit will tell you what to sing,
When they persecute you in one town, flee,
A student is not above his teacher, you see.
What I tell you in darkness, speak in light,
What's whispered in your ear, proclaim with might.

[Chorus]
I send you out as sheep among wolves tonight,
Be wise as serpents, gentle as doves in flight,
Don't fear those who kill the body alone,
Fear Him who judges—before His throne.

[Bridge]
Not even a sparrow falls without His care,
Every hair on your head—He counts them there,
Whoever acknowledges Me before men,
I'll acknowledge before My Father. Amen.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Lord, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
