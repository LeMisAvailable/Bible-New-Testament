        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Whoever sows sparingly will reap that way too,<br>
But generous sowing brings a harvest to you,<br>
Each one should give what they have decided in heart,<br>
Not reluctantly or under compulsion, but as a new start.<br>
For God loves a cheerful giver, this is His way,<br>
And He's able to bless you abundantly each day.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
God loves a cheerful giver, open hands, open heart,<br>
In every good work, He'll give you a part,<br>
He supplies seed to the sower and bread for your food,<br>
He'll increase your store of righteousness, multiplying good,<br>
Cheerful giver, living as His children should.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God,<br>
Others will praise Him for the gracious path you trod,<br>
This service supplies the needs of the saints,<br>
And overflows in many expressions without restraints.<br>
They'll pray for you with deep affection and care,<br>
Because of the surpassing grace God gives you to share.

His Son who came to heal our rift,<br>
The ultimate generosity from above,<br>
An eternal sacrifice of perfect love.

When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
Whoever sows sparingly will reap that way too,
But generous sowing brings a harvest to you,
Each one should give what they have decided in heart,
Not reluctantly or under compulsion, but as a new start.
For God loves a cheerful giver, this is His way,
And He's able to bless you abundantly each day.

[Chorus]
God loves a cheerful giver, open hands, open heart,
In every good work, He'll give you a part,
He supplies seed to the sower and bread for your food,
He'll increase your store of righteousness, multiplying good,
Cheerful giver, living as His children should.

[Verse 2]
Your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God,
Others will praise Him for the gracious path you trod,
This service supplies the needs of the saints,
And overflows in many expressions without restraints.
They'll pray for you with deep affection and care,
Because of the surpassing grace God gives you to share.

[Chorus]
God loves a cheerful giver, open hands, open heart,
In every good work, He'll give you a part,
He supplies seed to the sower and bread for your food,
He'll increase your store of righteousness, multiplying good,
Cheerful giver, living as His children should.

[Bridge]
Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift,
His Son who came to heal our rift,
The ultimate generosity from above,
An eternal sacrifice of perfect love.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
