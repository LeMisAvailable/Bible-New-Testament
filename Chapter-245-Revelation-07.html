[Verse 1]
Four angels held the winds at every corner of the earth,
Another rose from sunrise with a seal of holy worth,
"Do not harm the land or sea until we mark the ones,
Servants of our God, both daughters and the sons."
One hundred forty-four thousand from Israel's tribes set apart,
Sealed upon their foreheads, written on their heart.

[Chorus]
A multitude that no one could ever count,
From every nation standing at the fount,
Robed in white, with palm branches raised on high,
"Salvation belongs to our God!" their cry.

[Verse 2]
An elder asked John, "Who are these in robes of white?"
"You know, my lord," he answered in that holy light.
"These came out of tribulation, great and fierce and long,
They washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb so strong."
Before the throne they serve Him day and night within,
He shelters them forever, free from death and sin.

[Chorus]
A multitude that no one could ever count,
From every nation standing at the fount,
Robed in white, with palm branches raised on high,
"Salvation belongs to our God!" their cry.

[Bridge]
No more hunger, no more thirst again,
The Lamb will shepherd them through every pain,
He'll lead them to the springs of living water clear,
And God will wipe away every single tear.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
