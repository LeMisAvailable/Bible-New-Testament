        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
On the isle of Patmos, exiled and alone,<br>
John heard a voice like thunder from the throne,<br>
"I am the First and Last, the Living One,"<br>
The risen Christ revealed, brighter than the sun.<br>
Seven golden lampstands circling where He stood,<br>
Eyes like blazing fire, feet like burnished wood.

Alpha and Omega, Beginning and the End,<br>
The One who was and is and comes again,<br>
He holds the keys to death, He conquered every grave,<br>
The First, the Last, the Eternal One who saves.

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
His hair was white as wool, pure as winter snow,<br>
From His mouth a sword of truth would flow,<br>
He laid His hand on John, said "Do not fear,<br>
I died, but now I live—forever I am here."<br>
Write down what you see, the mystery unfolds,<br>
A revelation greater than earth holds.

Every eye will see Him when He comes in glory,<br>
Every knee will bow to tell the ancient story,<br>
He who loves us, freed us by His blood,<br>
Made us kings and priests unto our God.

When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
On the isle of Patmos, exiled and alone,
John heard a voice like thunder from the throne,
"I am the First and Last, the Living One,"
The risen Christ revealed, brighter than the sun.
Seven golden lampstands circling where He stood,
Eyes like blazing fire, feet like burnished wood.

[Chorus]
Alpha and Omega, Beginning and the End,
The One who was and is and comes again,
He holds the keys to death, He conquered every grave,
The First, the Last, the Eternal One who saves.

[Verse 2]
His hair was white as wool, pure as winter snow,
From His mouth a sword of truth would flow,
He laid His hand on John, said "Do not fear,
I died, but now I live—forever I am here."
Write down what you see, the mystery unfolds,
A revelation greater than earth holds.

[Chorus]
Alpha and Omega, Beginning and the End,
The One who was and is and comes again,
He holds the keys to death, He conquered every grave,
The First, the Last, the Eternal One who saves.

[Bridge]
Every eye will see Him when He comes in glory,
Every knee will bow to tell the ancient story,
He who loves us, freed us by His blood,
Made us kings and priests unto our God.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
