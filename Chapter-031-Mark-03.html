        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
In the synagogue, a withered hand,<br>
Jesus asked, "What does the law demand?<br>
Is it right to do good or to harm?"<br>
Silence fell like a coming storm.<br>
"Stretch out your hand"—completely restored,<br>
But the Pharisees plotted against the Lord.

        <div class="chorus">
He appointed twelve to be with Him,<br>
To preach the Word from rim to rim,<br>
Authority over demons given that day,<br>
Sent to drive every evil away.

        <div class="verse">
Crowds pressed in from everywhere,<br>
Evil spirits knew who was there,<br>
"You are the Son of God!" they'd cry,<br>
But Jesus silenced them passing by.<br>
Up on the mountain, He called His own,<br>
Twelve apostles, the seeds were sown.

[Verse 1]
In the synagogue, a withered hand,
Jesus asked, "What does the law demand?
Is it right to do good or to harm?"
Silence fell like a coming storm.
"Stretch out your hand"—completely restored,
But the Pharisees plotted against the Lord.

[Chorus]
He appointed twelve to be with Him,
To preach the Word from rim to rim,
Authority over demons given that day,
Sent to drive every evil away.

[Verse 2]
Crowds pressed in from everywhere,
Evil spirits knew who was there,
"You are the Son of God!" they'd cry,
But Jesus silenced them passing by.
Up on the mountain, He called His own,
Twelve apostles, the seeds were sown.

[Chorus]
He appointed twelve to be with Him,
To preach the Word from rim to rim,
Authority over demons given that day,
Sent to drive every evil away.

[Bridge]
"He's out of His mind," His family said,
"By the prince of demons," the teachers spread,
A house divided cannot stand tall,
But the Spirit's power conquers all.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
