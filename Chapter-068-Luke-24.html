[Verse 1]
At dawn the women came with spice,
To honor Him who paid the price,
But the stone was rolled away,
The tomb was empty on that day.
Two angels spoke in robes so bright,
"Why seek the living among the night?"

[Chorus]
He is risen, He's alive,
Death has lost, love will survive,
Remember how He spoke to you,
Everything He said was true.
The Son of Man was crucified,
But on the third day, He would rise!

[Verse 2]
On the road to Emmaus they walked,
With a stranger who gently talked,
Through Moses and prophets, He explained,
How the Christ must suffer and be slain.
At the table, He broke the bread,
Then their eyes saw—it was Him, they said!

[Chorus]
He is risen, He's alive,
Death has lost, love will survive,
Remember how He spoke to you,
Everything He said was true.
The Son of Man was crucified,
But on the third day, He would rise!

[Bridge]
He appeared among the eleven,
"Peace be with you," words from heaven,
Touch My hands, see My feet,
This is real, the victory's complete.
Then He lifted up His hands to bless,
And ascended in His righteousness.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
