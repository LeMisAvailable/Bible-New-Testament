        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Persecution scattered them abroad,<br>
Philip went to Samaria, preaching the Word of God,<br>
Unclean spirits fled with shrieks and cries,<br>
The paralyzed rose up before their eyes.<br>
Simon the sorcerer watched in awe,<br>
Amazed at miracles he never saw,<br>
He believed and was baptized that day,<br>
But his heart sought power in the wrong way.

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
On a desert road, an angel said, "Go south,"<br>
Philip obeyed, though questions filled his mouth,<br>
An Ethiopian chariot passed him by,<br>
Reading Isaiah beneath the sky.<br>
"Do you understand the words you read?"<br>
"How can I, unless someone lead?"<br>
Philip climbed in, opened the scroll,<br>
And told the good news that saved his soul.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
"Like a sheep led to the slaughter," the passage said,<br>
"Who is the prophet speaking of?" his questions led,<br>
Philip began with that very place,<br>
And preached to him Jesus, full of grace.<br>
"Look, here is water! What prevents me now?"<br>
Down into the stream they went somehow,<br>
Baptized in faith, he rose anew,<br>
And Philip vanished from his view.

His heart was free, his spirit voicing,<br>
Praise to the God who sent a guide,<br>
To walk with him and be his light.

[Verse 1]
Persecution scattered them abroad,
Philip went to Samaria, preaching the Word of God,
Unclean spirits fled with shrieks and cries,
The paralyzed rose up before their eyes.
Simon the sorcerer watched in awe,
Amazed at miracles he never saw,
He believed and was baptized that day,
But his heart sought power in the wrong way.

[Chorus]
On a desert road, an angel said, "Go south,"
Philip obeyed, though questions filled his mouth,
An Ethiopian chariot passed him by,
Reading Isaiah beneath the sky.
"Do you understand the words you read?"
"How can I, unless someone lead?"
Philip climbed in, opened the scroll,
And told the good news that saved his soul.

[Verse 2]
"Like a sheep led to the slaughter," the passage said,
"Who is the prophet speaking of?" his questions led,
Philip began with that very place,
And preached to him Jesus, full of grace.
"Look, here is water! What prevents me now?"
Down into the stream they went somehow,
Baptized in faith, he rose anew,
And Philip vanished from his view.

[Chorus]
On a desert road, an angel said, "Go south,"
Philip obeyed, though questions filled his mouth,
An Ethiopian chariot passed him by,
Reading Isaiah beneath the sky.
"Do you understand the words you read?"
"How can I, unless someone lead?"
Philip climbed in, opened the scroll,
And told the good news that saved his soul.

[Bridge]
The eunuch went on his way rejoicing,
His heart was free, his spirit voicing,
Praise to the God who sent a guide,
To walk with him and be his light.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
