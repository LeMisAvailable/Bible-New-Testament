        <p class="subtitle">Hebrews Chapter 2</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Emotional Worship Anthem</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
We must pay attention, hold on to the truth,<br>
Don't drift away like waves without roots,<br>
If the word through angels proved to be true,<br>
How shall we escape what God calls us to?<br>
Signs and wonders confirmed from above,<br>
The message of salvation sealed with His love.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
He became like us, flesh and blood and bone,<br>
So we'd never have to face death alone,<br>
Through suffering made perfect, our merciful King,<br>
He calls us His family, brothers we sing.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
What is man that You are mindful of him?<br>
Crowned with glory though the world looks so grim,<br>
For a moment lower than angels He came,<br>
Tasting death for everyone, bearing our shame.<br>
He destroyed the devil who held us in fear,<br>
Now in freedom and hope, His children draw near.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
He became like us, flesh and blood and bone,<br>
So we'd never have to face death alone,<br>
Through suffering made perfect, our merciful King,<br>
He calls us His family, brothers we sing.

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
He was tempted in every way we know,<br>
So He helps us wherever we go,<br>
Not ashamed to call us His own,<br>
Leading many to glory, bringing us home.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Lord, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
We must pay attention, hold on to the truth,
Don't drift away like waves without roots,
If the word through angels proved to be true,
How shall we escape what God calls us to?
Signs and wonders confirmed from above,
The message of salvation sealed with His love.

[Chorus]
He became like us, flesh and blood and bone,
So we'd never have to face death alone,
Through suffering made perfect, our merciful King,
He calls us His family, brothers we sing.

[Verse 2]
What is man that You are mindful of him?
Crowned with glory though the world looks so grim,
For a moment lower than angels He came,
Tasting death for everyone, bearing our shame.
He destroyed the devil who held us in fear,
Now in freedom and hope, His children draw near.

[Chorus]
He became like us, flesh and blood and bone,
So we'd never have to face death alone,
Through suffering made perfect, our merciful King,
He calls us His family, brothers we sing.

[Bridge]
He was tempted in every way we know,
So He helps us wherever we go,
Not ashamed to call us His own,
Leading many to glory, bringing us home.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Lord, though I cannot see Your hand,
