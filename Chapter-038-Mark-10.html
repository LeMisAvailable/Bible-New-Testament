Let the little children come to Me,<br>
For such is the kingdom, don't you see?<br>
Receive it like a child so small,<br>
With humble faith that gives your all.<br>
Jesus blessed them, held them near,<br>
Their innocence He held so dear.

Sell all you have and follow Me,<br>
Treasure in heaven, eternally,<br>
With God all things are possible,<br>
His love makes broken hearts whole,<br>
Sell all you have and follow Me.

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
A rich young ruler ran to Him,<br>
"Good Teacher, how do I begin?"<br>
Jesus looked and loved him so,<br>
"One thing you lack—let riches go."<br>
He walked away with saddened face,<br>
His wealth too precious to replace.

The first shall be last, the last be first,<br>
The Son of Man came to serve, not be served,<br>
To give His life a ransom for many,<br>
His sacrifice worth more than any.

Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
Let the little children come to Me,
For such is the kingdom, don't you see?
Receive it like a child so small,
With humble faith that gives your all.
Jesus blessed them, held them near,
Their innocence He held so dear.

[Chorus]
Sell all you have and follow Me,
Treasure in heaven, eternally,
With God all things are possible,
His love makes broken hearts whole,
Sell all you have and follow Me.

[Verse 2]
A rich young ruler ran to Him,
"Good Teacher, how do I begin?"
Jesus looked and loved him so,
"One thing you lack—let riches go."
He walked away with saddened face,
His wealth too precious to replace.

[Chorus]
Sell all you have and follow Me,
Treasure in heaven, eternally,
With God all things are possible,
His love makes broken hearts whole,
Sell all you have and follow Me.

[Bridge]
The first shall be last, the last be first,
The Son of Man came to serve, not be served,
To give His life a ransom for many,
His sacrifice worth more than any.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
