The church was growing, spreading wide,<br>

Even in the darkness, he was light,<br>
Falsely accused but standing tall,<br>
Stephen answered the Spirit's call.

(Devotional Ballad, Emotional, Orchestral, Reverent)

[Verse 1]
The church was growing, spreading wide,
But widows were neglected, pushed aside,
The apostles gathered, sought the Lord,
"We must give ourselves to prayer and word."
Seven men of wisdom, full of Spirit's power,
Chosen for this calling in that hour,
Stephen stood among them, grace upon his face,
A man who walked with heaven's embrace.

[Chorus]
Full of grace and power, Stephen rose,
Doing wonders among the crowds he goes,
But they could not withstand his wisdom's flame,
So they stirred up lies against his name.
His face shone like an angel bright,
Even in the darkness, he was light,
Falsely accused but standing tall,
Stephen answered the Spirit's call.

[Verse 2]
They brought false witnesses to speak,
"He blasphemes against the law we keep,
He says this Jesus will destroy,
The customs Moses did employ."
All who sat in the council hall,
Saw his face shine bright for all,
Like an angel from on high,
The glory of God was standing by.

[Chorus]
Full of grace and power, Stephen rose,
Doing wonders among the crowds he goes,
But they could not withstand his wisdom's flame,
So they stirred up lies against his name.
His face shone like an angel bright,
Even in the darkness, he was light,
Falsely accused but standing tall,
Stephen answered the Spirit's call.

[Bridge]
Serve with gladness, humble heart,
Every role can be a sacred art,
Whether at the table or in prayer,
God sees the love we choose to share.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
