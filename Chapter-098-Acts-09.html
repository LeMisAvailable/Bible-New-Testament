Saul was breathing threats and murder's fire,<br>
Letters in hand, his rage climbed higher,<br>
Damascus bound to imprison the Way,<br>
But heaven had plans for him that day.<br>
A light from heaven, brighter than the sun,<br>
Struck him down before his work was done,<br>
A voice called out, "Saul, why do you fight?<br>
Why do you persecute Me with all your might?"

"Who are You, Lord?" he cried in fear,<br>
"I am Jesus, the One you persecute here."<br>
Three days blind, no food or drink,<br>
Alone in darkness, forced to think.<br>
But Ananias came with trembling hand,<br>
"Brother Saul, the Lord has a plan,<br>
Receive your sight, be filled with power,<br>
You're a chosen vessel from this hour."

Like scales fell from his opened eyes,<br>

"Jesus is the Son of God, the Light!"<br>
They tried to kill him, lowered him by night,<br>
In a basket through the wall, out of sight.

[Verse 1]
Saul was breathing threats and murder's fire,
Letters in hand, his rage climbed higher,
Damascus bound to imprison the Way,
But heaven had plans for him that day.
A light from heaven, brighter than the sun,
Struck him down before his work was done,
A voice called out, "Saul, why do you fight?
Why do you persecute Me with all your might?"

[Chorus]
"Who are You, Lord?" he cried in fear,
"I am Jesus, the One you persecute here."
Three days blind, no food or drink,
Alone in darkness, forced to think.
But Ananias came with trembling hand,
"Brother Saul, the Lord has a plan,
Receive your sight, be filled with power,
You're a chosen vessel from this hour."

[Verse 2]
Like scales fell from his opened eyes,
He rose and was baptized to his surprise,
The persecutor now proclaimed the name,
The very Christ he'd tried to shame.
In synagogues he preached with might,
"Jesus is the Son of God, the Light!"
They tried to kill him, lowered him by night,
In a basket through the wall, out of sight.

[Chorus]
"Who are You, Lord?" he cried in fear,
"I am Jesus, the One you persecute here."
Three days blind, no food or drink,
Alone in darkness, forced to think.
But Ananias came with trembling hand,
"Brother Saul, the Lord has a plan,
Receive your sight, be filled with power,
You're a chosen vessel from this hour."

[Bridge]
No one is too far gone for grace,
No enemy too lost to embrace,
The one who hunted now was found,
By love that turned his world around.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
