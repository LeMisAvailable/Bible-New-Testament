        <h1>Bound for Jerusalem</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Acts Chapter 21</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
The prophet Agabus took Paul's belt in hand,<br>
Bound his feet and spoke what God had planned,<br>
"The man who owns this belt will be confined,<br>
Delivered to the Gentiles, hands entwined."<br>
The brothers begged him not to go that day,<br>
But Paul would walk the sacrificial way.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
I am ready not only to be bound,<br>
But to die where holy ground is found,<br>
For the name of Jesus I will stand,<br>
My life is held within His hand.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
In Jerusalem the temple crowds grew wild,<br>
Accusations flew like fire unreconciled,<br>
"He brings Greeks inside this sacred space!"<br>
They dragged him out with hatred on each face.<br>
The soldiers came and bound him with their chains,<br>
Yet courage in his heart remained.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
I am ready not only to be bound,<br>
But to die where holy ground is found,<br>
For the name of Jesus I will stand,<br>
My life is held within His hand.
        </div>

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
The will of God be done, the people cried,<br>
No longer begging Paul to step aside,<br>
Sometimes the path of love leads through the fire,<br>
Surrender is devotion's true desire.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
The prophet Agabus took Paul's belt in hand,
Bound his feet and spoke what God had planned,
"The man who owns this belt will be confined,
Delivered to the Gentiles, hands entwined."
The brothers begged him not to go that day,
But Paul would walk the sacrificial way.

[Chorus]
I am ready not only to be bound,
But to die where holy ground is found,
For the name of Jesus I will stand,
My life is held within His hand.

[Verse 2]
In Jerusalem the temple crowds grew wild,
Accusations flew like fire unreconciled,
"He brings Greeks inside this sacred space!"
They dragged him out with hatred on each face.
The soldiers came and bound him with their chains,
Yet courage in his heart remained.

[Chorus]
I am ready not only to be bound,
But to die where holy ground is found,
For the name of Jesus I will stand,
My life is held within His hand.

[Bridge]
The will of God be done, the people cried,
No longer begging Paul to step aside,
Sometimes the path of love leads through the fire,
Surrender is devotion's true desire.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
