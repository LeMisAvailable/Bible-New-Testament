        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
A landowner hired workers at dawn,<br>
Agreed on a wage before moving on,<br>
At noon and at three, he brought in more,<br>
Even the eleventh hour opened the door.<br>
When evening came, he paid them all the same,<br>
The first were angry, but who's to blame?

        <div class="chorus">
The last shall be first, and the first shall be last,<br>
God's grace isn't earned by the hours we've passed,<br>
His generosity flows to every soul,<br>
His kingdom's not fair—it's making us whole.

        <div class="verse">
A mother came asking thrones for her sons,<br>
"Can they sit beside You when victory's won?"<br>
"You don't know what you ask," Jesus replied,<br>
"Can you drink the cup?"—they said yes with pride,<br>
"You will drink it, but seats are not Mine to give,<br>
The Father decides how glory will live."

Two blind men cried out by the road that day,<br>

Jesus stopped and touched their eyes with grace,<br>
They followed Him, seeing His glorious face.

[Verse 1]
A landowner hired workers at dawn,
Agreed on a wage before moving on,
At noon and at three, he brought in more,
Even the eleventh hour opened the door.
When evening came, he paid them all the same,
The first were angry, but who's to blame?

[Chorus]
The last shall be first, and the first shall be last,
God's grace isn't earned by the hours we've passed,
His generosity flows to every soul,
His kingdom's not fair—it's making us whole.

[Verse 2]
A mother came asking thrones for her sons,
"Can they sit beside You when victory's won?"
"You don't know what you ask," Jesus replied,
"Can you drink the cup?"—they said yes with pride,
"You will drink it, but seats are not Mine to give,
The Father decides how glory will live."

[Chorus]
The last shall be first, and the first shall be last,
God's grace isn't earned by the hours we've passed,
His generosity flows to every soul,
His kingdom's not fair—it's making us whole.

[Bridge]
Two blind men cried out by the road that day,
"Son of David, have mercy!" they would say,
Jesus stopped and touched their eyes with grace,
They followed Him, seeing His glorious face.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
