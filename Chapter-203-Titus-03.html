        <p class="subtitle">Titus Chapter 3</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Remind them to be subject to the throne,<br>
To rulers and authorities, fully known,<br>
Ready for every good work that appears,<br>
Gentle to all people, casting off fears.<br>
For we ourselves were once foolish and led,<br>
By passions and pleasures that filled us with dread.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
But when the kindness and love of God appeared,<br>
He saved us—not by works that we had neared,<br>
But by His mercy, the washing of rebirth,<br>
The Holy Spirit poured out on the earth.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Justified by His grace, heirs of the promise,<br>
Hope of eternal life—nothing amiss,<br>
This saying is trustworthy, hold it tight,<br>
Insist on good works, living in the light.<br>
Avoid foolish controversies and strife,<br>
They are unprofitable for this life.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
Let our people learn to devote their days,<br>
To good works, meeting needs in righteous ways,<br>
So they may not be unfruitful but grow,<br>
In the love and grace that overflows.

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

(Devotional Ballad, Emotional, Orchestral, Reverent)

[Verse 1]
Remind them to be subject to the throne,
To rulers and authorities, fully known,
Ready for every good work that appears,
Gentle to all people, casting off fears.
For we ourselves were once foolish and led,
By passions and pleasures that filled us with dread.

[Chorus]
But when the kindness and love of God appeared,
He saved us—not by works that we had neared,
But by His mercy, the washing of rebirth,
The Holy Spirit poured out on the earth.

[Verse 2]
Justified by His grace, heirs of the promise,
Hope of eternal life—nothing amiss,
This saying is trustworthy, hold it tight,
Insist on good works, living in the light.
Avoid foolish controversies and strife,
They are unprofitable for this life.

[Chorus]
But when the kindness and love of God appeared,
He saved us—not by works that we had neared,
But by His mercy, the washing of rebirth,
The Holy Spirit poured out on the earth.

[Bridge]
Let our people learn to devote their days,
To good works, meeting needs in righteous ways,
So they may not be unfruitful but grow,
In the love and grace that overflows.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
