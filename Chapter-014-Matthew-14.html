        <h1>Walking on Water</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Matthew Chapter 14</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Epic Worship</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
John the Baptist, voice of truth, was silenced in the night,<br>
Herod's dark and broken promise stole the prophet's light,<br>
But Jesus heard and withdrew to mourn alone,<br>
Yet crowds followed, needing mercy shown.<br>
With compassion deep, He healed their every pain,<br>
And when evening came, a miracle would reign.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
Keep your eyes on Me when the waves are high,<br>
Step out of the boat, don't ask Me why,<br>
Even when you're sinking, reach for My hand,<br>
I'll lift you up—on the water you will stand.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Five loaves and two fish—what is this for so many?<br>
But in Jesus' hands, blessing flows like plenty,<br>
Five thousand fed, twelve baskets left behind,<br>
The Provider's heart, so generous and kind.<br>
Then He sent them ahead across the stormy sea,<br>
And climbed the mountain alone to pray and be.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
Keep your eyes on Me when the waves are high,<br>
Step out of the boat, don't ask Me why,<br>
Even when you're sinking, reach for My hand,<br>
I'll lift you up—on the water you will stand.
        </div>

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
In the fourth watch, Jesus came walking on the deep,<br>
Peter stepped out while others stayed asleep,<br>
But when he saw the wind, his faith began to fall,<br>
"Lord, save me!" he cried—and Jesus caught it all.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.
        </div>

[Verse 1]
John the Baptist, voice of truth, was silenced in the night,
Herod's dark and broken promise stole the prophet's light,
But Jesus heard and withdrew to mourn alone,
Yet crowds followed, needing mercy shown.
With compassion deep, He healed their every pain,
And when evening came, a miracle would reign.

[Chorus]
Keep your eyes on Me when the waves are high,
Step out of the boat, don't ask Me why,
Even when you're sinking, reach for My hand,
I'll lift you up—on the water you will stand.

[Verse 2]
Five loaves and two fish—what is this for so many?
But in Jesus' hands, blessing flows like plenty,
Five thousand fed, twelve baskets left behind,
The Provider's heart, so generous and kind.
Then He sent them ahead across the stormy sea,
And climbed the mountain alone to pray and be.

[Chorus]
Keep your eyes on Me when the waves are high,
Step out of the boat, don't ask Me why,
Even when you're sinking, reach for My hand,
I'll lift you up—on the water you will stand.

[Bridge]
In the fourth watch, Jesus came walking on the deep,
Peter stepped out while others stayed asleep,
But when he saw the wind, his faith began to fall,
"Lord, save me!" he cried—and Jesus caught it all.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
