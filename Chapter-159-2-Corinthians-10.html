        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Though we walk in the flesh, we don't wage war that way,<br>
Our weapons are not worldly, they're divine for the fray,<br>
They have power to demolish strongholds in the mind,<br>
Every argument against God, we leave behind.<br>
We take captive every thought, making it obey,<br>
Christ is our commander, leading us each day.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
This is spiritual warfare, not flesh and blood we fight,<br>
With weapons of the Spirit, we stand in holy might,<br>
Demolishing pretensions that rise against God's truth,<br>
We take every thought captive, bringing forth the proof,<br>
Spiritual warfare, in Christ we are the proof.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Look at what's before you, see what's really true,<br>
We belong to Christ just as much as you,<br>
Our authority was given to build you up, not tear down,<br>
In weakness we are strong, wearing heaven's crown.<br>
Let the one who boasts, boast only in the Lord,<br>
For it's His commendation that's our true reward.

But the one whom the Lord commends, unmoved,<br>
In His strength alone we stand and fight,<br>
His approval our glory, His praise our light.

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
Though we walk in the flesh, we don't wage war that way,
Our weapons are not worldly, they're divine for the fray,
They have power to demolish strongholds in the mind,
Every argument against God, we leave behind.
We take captive every thought, making it obey,
Christ is our commander, leading us each day.

[Chorus]
This is spiritual warfare, not flesh and blood we fight,
With weapons of the Spirit, we stand in holy might,
Demolishing pretensions that rise against God's truth,
We take every thought captive, bringing forth the proof,
Spiritual warfare, in Christ we are the proof.

[Verse 2]
Look at what's before you, see what's really true,
We belong to Christ just as much as you,
Our authority was given to build you up, not tear down,
In weakness we are strong, wearing heaven's crown.
Let the one who boasts, boast only in the Lord,
For it's His commendation that's our true reward.

[Chorus]
This is spiritual warfare, not flesh and blood we fight,
With weapons of the Spirit, we stand in holy might,
Demolishing pretensions that rise against God's truth,
We take every thought captive, bringing forth the proof,
Spiritual warfare, in Christ we are the proof.

[Bridge]
Not the one who commends himself is approved,
But the one whom the Lord commends, unmoved,
In His strength alone we stand and fight,
His approval our glory, His praise our light.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
