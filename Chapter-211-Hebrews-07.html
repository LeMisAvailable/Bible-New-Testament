        <p class="subtitle">Hebrews Chapter 7</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Epic Worship Anthem</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High,<br>
He blessed Abraham returning from the battle cry,<br>
Without father, without mother, no beginning and no end,<br>
Resembling the Son of God, a priest who will not bend.<br>
Even Levi paid him tithes through Abraham that day,<br>
The greater blesses the lesser in every way.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
A better hope is introduced through which we draw near,<br>
Jesus the guarantee of a covenant crystal clear,<br>
He holds His priesthood permanently, death cannot prevail,<br>
He saves completely those who come, His love will never fail.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
If perfection came through Levitical priest,<br>
Why another order rising from the East?<br>
The law made nothing perfect, it was weak and frail,<br>
But Jesus sworn with an oath will forever prevail.<br>
Not by law of ancestry but power of endless life,<br>
He intercedes forever, ending all our strife.

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>

A better hope is introduced through which we draw near,<br>
Jesus the guarantee of a covenant crystal clear,<br>

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
Holy, innocent, unstained, and set apart,<br>
Exalted above the heavens, pure of heart,<br>
He offered up Himself once for all mankind,<br>
A perfect priest eternal, one of a kind.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High,
He blessed Abraham returning from the battle cry,
Without father, without mother, no beginning and no end,
Resembling the Son of God, a priest who will not bend.
Even Levi paid him tithes through Abraham that day,
The greater blesses the lesser in every way.

[Chorus]
A better hope is introduced through which we draw near,
Jesus the guarantee of a covenant crystal clear,
He holds His priesthood permanently, death cannot prevail,
He saves completely those who come, His love will never fail.

[Verse 2]
If perfection came through Levitical priest,
Why another order rising from the East?
The law made nothing perfect, it was weak and frail,
But Jesus sworn with an oath will forever prevail.
Not by law of ancestry but power of endless life,
He intercedes forever, ending all our strife.

[Chorus]
A better hope is introduced through which we draw near,
Jesus the guarantee of a covenant crystal clear,
He holds His priesthood permanently, death cannot prevail,
He saves completely those who come, His love will never fail.

[Bridge]
Holy, innocent, unstained, and set apart,
Exalted above the heavens, pure of heart,
He offered up Himself once for all mankind,
A perfect priest eternal, one of a kind.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
