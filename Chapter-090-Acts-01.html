Forty days He walked among them,<br>
Speaking of the kingdom come,<br>
Teaching those who once had fled Him,<br>

The Spirit comes to dwell within you,<br>
This is not where the story ends."

From Jerusalem to the nations,<br>
His love will make the broken whole.

One hundred twenty hearts aflame,<br>

Matthias chosen by the casting,<br>
To fill the place that Judas left,<br>
United now in prayer and waiting,<br>
Their faith restored, no more bereft.

(Devotional Ballad, Emotional, Orchestral, Reverent)

[Verse 1]
Forty days He walked among them,
Speaking of the kingdom come,
Teaching those who once had fled Him,
Now their hearts beat as one.
"Wait in Jerusalem," He told them,
"Power from on high descends,
The Spirit comes to dwell within you,
This is not where the story ends."

[Chorus]
He ascended into heaven,
Clouds received Him from their sight,
But the angels brought a promise—
He will return in glorious light.
Wait upon the Lord, be steadfast,
His Spirit soon will fill your soul,
From Jerusalem to the nations,
His love will make the broken whole.

[Verse 2]
In the upper room they gathered,
One hundred twenty hearts aflame,
Peter stood to speak with courage,
A new apostle they must name.
Matthias chosen by the casting,
To fill the place that Judas left,
United now in prayer and waiting,
Their faith restored, no more bereft.

[Chorus]
He ascended into heaven,
Clouds received Him from their sight,
But the angels brought a promise—
He will return in glorious light.
Wait upon the Lord, be steadfast,
His Spirit soon will fill your soul,
From Jerusalem to the nations,
His love will make the broken whole.

[Bridge]
Why do you stand gazing upward?
This same Jesus will return,
In the waiting, find your purpose,
Let your heart for mission burn.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
