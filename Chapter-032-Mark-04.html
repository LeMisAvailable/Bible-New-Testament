        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
By the lake, He taught from a boat,<br>
Parables of seeds and where they'd float,<br>
Some on the path, the birds ate them quick,<br>
Some on rocks where roots couldn't stick.<br>
Thorns choked others, worries took hold,<br>
But good soil produced thirty, sixty, hundredfold.

        <div class="chorus">
Listen carefully, if you have ears to hear,<br>
The kingdom of God is growing near,<br>
Like a seed that grows while the farmer sleeps,<br>
The harvest is coming—the Lord reaps.

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
A lamp isn't hidden under a bowl,<br>
It's set on a stand to light every soul,<br>
With the measure you use, it will be measured to you,<br>
The more you give, the more comes through.<br>
The mustard seed, smallest of all,<br>
Becomes the greatest, standing tall.

        <div class="bridge">
A furious storm rose on the lake that night,<br>
Disciples panicked with all their might,<br>
"Teacher, don't You care if we drown?"<br>
He stood and rebuked—the wind calmed down.

When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
By the lake, He taught from a boat,
Parables of seeds and where they'd float,
Some on the path, the birds ate them quick,
Some on rocks where roots couldn't stick.
Thorns choked others, worries took hold,
But good soil produced thirty, sixty, hundredfold.

[Chorus]
Listen carefully, if you have ears to hear,
The kingdom of God is growing near,
Like a seed that grows while the farmer sleeps,
The harvest is coming—the Lord reaps.

[Verse 2]
A lamp isn't hidden under a bowl,
It's set on a stand to light every soul,
With the measure you use, it will be measured to you,
The more you give, the more comes through.
The mustard seed, smallest of all,
Becomes the greatest, standing tall.

[Chorus]
Listen carefully, if you have ears to hear,
The kingdom of God is growing near,
Like a seed that grows while the farmer sleeps,
The harvest is coming—the Lord reaps.

[Bridge]
A furious storm rose on the lake that night,
Disciples panicked with all their might,
"Teacher, don't You care if we drown?"
He stood and rebuked—the wind calmed down.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
