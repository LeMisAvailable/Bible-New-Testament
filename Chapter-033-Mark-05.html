        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
A man possessed lived among the tombs,<br>
Chains couldn't hold him, darkness loomed,<br>
Night and day he cried and bled,<br>
"Legion" was his name, the demons said.<br>
Jesus spoke with power and might,<br>
"Come out!"—and they fled into swine that night.

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
No case too hopeless, no chain too strong,<br>
Jesus breaks the darkness where we belong,<br>
Clothed and in his right mind, set free,<br>
"Go tell your family what God did for thee."

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
A woman suffering twelve years long,<br>
Doctors failed, her hope was gone,<br>
"If I just touch His cloak," she thought,<br>
Instantly healed—the healing she sought.<br>
"Who touched Me?" Jesus turned around,<br>
"Your faith has healed you," peace she found.

When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
A man possessed lived among the tombs,
Chains couldn't hold him, darkness loomed,
Night and day he cried and bled,
"Legion" was his name, the demons said.
Jesus spoke with power and might,
"Come out!"—and they fled into swine that night.

[Chorus]
No case too hopeless, no chain too strong,
Jesus breaks the darkness where we belong,
Clothed and in his right mind, set free,
"Go tell your family what God did for thee."

[Verse 2]
A woman suffering twelve years long,
Doctors failed, her hope was gone,
"If I just touch His cloak," she thought,
Instantly healed—the healing she sought.
"Who touched Me?" Jesus turned around,
"Your faith has healed you," peace she found.

[Chorus]
No case too hopeless, no chain too strong,
Jesus breaks the darkness where we belong,
Clothed and in his right mind, set free,
"Go tell your family what God did for thee."

[Bridge]
Jairus begged for his daughter's life,
But messengers came with news of strife,
"Don't be afraid, just believe," Jesus said,
"Talitha koum!"—and she rose from the dead.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
