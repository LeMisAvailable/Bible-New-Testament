[Verse 1]
Abraham believed the Lord above,
And it was counted, an act of love,
Not by works that he had done,
But by faith in the Holy One.
To the one who does not work but trusts,
His faith is credited as just.

[Chorus]
Blessed are those whose sins are covered,
Whose transgressions are forgiven, discovered,
The Lord will never count their wrong,
By faith we sing this ancient song.

[Verse 2]
Before the law, before the sign,
His faith was counted right, divine,
Father of all who would believe,
A promise that we now receive.
Against all hope, Abraham believed,
And from his faith, nations conceived.

[Chorus]
Blessed are those whose sins are covered,
Whose transgressions are forgiven, discovered,
The Lord will never count their wrong,
By faith we sing this ancient song.

[Bridge]
His body old, as good as dead,
Yet still he trusted what God said,
He did not waver in unbelief,
But grew in strength beyond all grief.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
