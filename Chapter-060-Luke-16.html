        <p class="subtitle">Luke Chapter 16</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
A manager was shrewd and wise,<br>
He planned ahead before his demise,<br>
Using worldly wealth to make a friend,<br>
Thinking clearly of his end.<br>
Faithful in little, faithful in much,<br>
You cannot serve both gold and such.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
You cannot serve two masters here,<br>
One you'll love, the other you'll fear,<br>
God or money—make your choice today,<br>
For eternity is not far away.<br>
What is prized by human eyes,<br>
Is detestable where heaven lies.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
A rich man dressed in purple fine,<br>
While Lazarus begged and longed to dine,<br>
On crumbs that fell from the wealthy floor,<br>
While dogs licked at his sores.<br>
Death came for both that fateful day,<br>
But their paths went different ways.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
You cannot serve two masters here,<br>

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
A chasm fixed, no crossing found,<br>
The rich man cried from torment's ground,<br>
"Send someone from the dead," he pled,<br>
"They have Moses," Abraham said.<br>
If they won't hear the prophets' voice,<br>
Even the risen won't change their choice.

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

(Devotional Ballad, Emotional, Orchestral, Reverent)

[Verse 1]
A manager was shrewd and wise,
He planned ahead before his demise,
Using worldly wealth to make a friend,
Thinking clearly of his end.
Faithful in little, faithful in much,
You cannot serve both gold and such.

[Chorus]
You cannot serve two masters here,
One you'll love, the other you'll fear,
God or money—make your choice today,
For eternity is not far away.
What is prized by human eyes,
Is detestable where heaven lies.

[Verse 2]
A rich man dressed in purple fine,
While Lazarus begged and longed to dine,
On crumbs that fell from the wealthy floor,
While dogs licked at his sores.
Death came for both that fateful day,
But their paths went different ways.

[Chorus]
You cannot serve two masters here,
One you'll love, the other you'll fear,
God or money—make your choice today,
For eternity is not far away.
What is prized by human eyes,
Is detestable where heaven lies.

[Bridge]
A chasm fixed, no crossing found,
The rich man cried from torment's ground,
"Send someone from the dead," he pled,
"They have Moses," Abraham said.
If they won't hear the prophets' voice,
Even the risen won't change their choice.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
