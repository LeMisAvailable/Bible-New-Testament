Born in darkness, never seen the day,<br>
"Who sinned?" they asked along the way,<br>

He made clay, anointed his eyes,<br>
"Go wash in Siloam," and light would rise.

The Pharisees questioned night and day,<br>
His parents feared what they might say,<br>

They cast him out for speaking true,<br>
But Jesus came and found him new.

[Verse 1]
Born in darkness, never seen the day,
"Who sinned?" they asked along the way,
"Neither," Jesus said with care,
"God's works through him shall be declared."
He made clay, anointed his eyes,
"Go wash in Siloam," and light would rise.

[Chorus]
Once I was blind, but now I see,
Amazing grace has rescued me,
I don't know everything He's done,
But I know now I see the Son.

[Verse 2]
The Pharisees questioned night and day,
His parents feared what they might say,
"Is He a sinner? We don't know,
But one thing's certain—my eyes now glow."
They cast him out for speaking true,
But Jesus came and found him new.

[Chorus]
Once I was blind, but now I see,
Amazing grace has rescued me,
I don't know everything He's done,
But I know now I see the Son.

[Bridge]
"Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
"Lord, I believe!" he took his stand,
The blind now see, the seeing blind,
In Jesus, true sight we find.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
