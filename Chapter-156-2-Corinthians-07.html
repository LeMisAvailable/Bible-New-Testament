        <h1>Godly Sorrow</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">2 Corinthians Chapter 7</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Let us purify ourselves from every stain,<br>
Perfecting holiness in reverent refrain,<br>
Make room in your hearts, we wronged no one,<br>
Our joy overflows for what God has done.<br>
Even when we came to Macedonia's shore,<br>
Our bodies found no rest, yet You gave us more.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
Godly sorrow brings repentance that saves,<br>
Not worldly grief that leads us to our graves,<br>
It produces earnestness, a longing to be right,<br>
Indignation at sin, and a zeal to fight,<br>
Godly sorrow leads us back into the light.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
The letter that was sent may have caused you pain,<br>
But not regret, for through it you were changed,<br>
Your sorrow led to action, your tears led to joy,<br>
A harvest of righteousness nothing can destroy.<br>
God who comforts the downcast lifted us high,<br>
When Titus came with news that made our spirits fly.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
Godly sorrow brings repentance that saves,<br>
Not worldly grief that leads us to our graves,<br>
It produces earnestness, a longing to be right,<br>
Indignation at sin, and a zeal to fight,<br>
Godly sorrow leads us back into the light.
        </div>

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
See what this godly sorrow has produced,<br>
Eagerness to clear your name, concern to be loosed,<br>
Alarm and longing, deep devotion true,<br>
At every point you proved yourselves renewed.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.
        </div>

(Devotional Ballad, Emotional, Orchestral, Reverent)

[Verse 1]
Let us purify ourselves from every stain,
Perfecting holiness in reverent refrain,
Make room in your hearts, we wronged no one,
Our joy overflows for what God has done.
Even when we came to Macedonia's shore,
Our bodies found no rest, yet You gave us more.

[Chorus]
Godly sorrow brings repentance that saves,
Not worldly grief that leads us to our graves,
It produces earnestness, a longing to be right,
Indignation at sin, and a zeal to fight,
Godly sorrow leads us back into the light.

[Verse 2]
The letter that was sent may have caused you pain,
But not regret, for through it you were changed,
Your sorrow led to action, your tears led to joy,
A harvest of righteousness nothing can destroy.
God who comforts the downcast lifted us high,
When Titus came with news that made our spirits fly.

[Chorus]
Godly sorrow brings repentance that saves,
Not worldly grief that leads us to our graves,
It produces earnestness, a longing to be right,
Indignation at sin, and a zeal to fight,
Godly sorrow leads us back into the light.

[Bridge]
See what this godly sorrow has produced,
Eagerness to clear your name, concern to be loosed,
Alarm and longing, deep devotion true,
At every point you proved yourselves renewed.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
