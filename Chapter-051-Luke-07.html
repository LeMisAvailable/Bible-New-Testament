        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
A centurion sent word from afar,<br>
"Lord, my servant lies beneath death's scar,<br>
I'm not worthy that You'd come to me,<br>
Just say the word, and he'll be free."<br>
Jesus marveled at this soldier's trust,<br>
Such faith in Israel? None so just.

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
Great is your faith that moves the hand of God,<br>
Great is your love that walks where others never trod,<br>
The broken find their healing at His feet,<br>
Where sinners and the Savior meet.

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
A woman came with tears and alabaster,<br>
Her sins were many, but her love came faster,<br>
She washed His feet with sorrow's rain,<br>
And kissed away her guilt and shame.<br>
"Your sins are forgiven," Jesus said,<br>
"Your faith has saved you, go ahead."

At Nain's gate, a widow wept alone,<br>
Her only son was dead and gone,<br>
But Jesus said, "Young man, arise!"<br>
And death surrendered to Life's surprise.

When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
A centurion sent word from afar,
"Lord, my servant lies beneath death's scar,
I'm not worthy that You'd come to me,
Just say the word, and he'll be free."
Jesus marveled at this soldier's trust,
Such faith in Israel? None so just.

[Chorus]
Great is your faith that moves the hand of God,
Great is your love that walks where others never trod,
The broken find their healing at His feet,
Where sinners and the Savior meet.

[Verse 2]
A woman came with tears and alabaster,
Her sins were many, but her love came faster,
She washed His feet with sorrow's rain,
And kissed away her guilt and shame.
"Your sins are forgiven," Jesus said,
"Your faith has saved you, go ahead."

[Chorus]
Great is your faith that moves the hand of God,
Great is your love that walks where others never trod,
The broken find their healing at His feet,
Where sinners and the Savior meet.

[Bridge]
At Nain's gate, a widow wept alone,
Her only son was dead and gone,
But Jesus said, "Young man, arise!"
And death surrendered to Life's surprise.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
