Ten virgins waited for the groom to come,<br>
Five were wise, but five had none,<br>
Oil in their lamps, prepared to shine,<br>

Keep watch and be ready, always stay aware.

Well done, good and faithful one,<br>
Enter the joy of what I've begun,<br>
You were faithful with a little given,<br>
Now rule over much in the kingdom of heaven.

        <div class="verse">
A master gave talents before he went away,<br>
Five, two, and one—to invest and play,<br>

But the one who buried his was deceived.<br>
"You wicked servant, you should have tried,"<br>
To those who have, more will be supplied.

Thirsty and naked, you showed your good,<br>

[Verse 1]
Ten virgins waited for the groom to come,
Five were wise, but five had none,
Oil in their lamps, prepared to shine,
When midnight called, they crossed the line.
"I don't know you," to those unprepared,
Keep watch and be ready, always stay aware.

[Chorus]
Well done, good and faithful one,
Enter the joy of what I've begun,
You were faithful with a little given,
Now rule over much in the kingdom of heaven.

[Verse 2]
A master gave talents before he went away,
Five, two, and one—to invest and play,
The first two doubled what they had received,
But the one who buried his was deceived.
"You wicked servant, you should have tried,"
To those who have, more will be supplied.

[Chorus]
Well done, good and faithful one,
Enter the joy of what I've begun,
You were faithful with a little given,
Now rule over much in the kingdom of heaven.

[Bridge]
When I was hungry, you gave Me food,
Thirsty and naked, you showed your good,
Stranger and prisoner, you came to Me,
Whatever you do for the least, you do for Me.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
