        <p class="subtitle">1 Peter Chapter 2</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Put away all malice, deceit, and envy's sting,<br>
Like newborn babes, long for the pure milk the Word brings,<br>
Come to Him, the living Stone rejected by men,<br>
But chosen and precious in God's sight again.<br>
You also, like living stones, are being built,<br>
A spiritual house where holy prayers are spilt.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,<br>
A holy nation, called from darkness for good,<br>
To declare His praises, His marvelous light,<br>
Once not a people, now His own delight.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Abstain from fleshly passions that wage war within,<br>
Keep conduct honorable so the lost may win,<br>
Submit to every human authority in place,<br>
Silence foolish people through your quiet grace.<br>
Live as servants of God, free yet bound by love,<br>
Honor everyone, fear God who reigns above.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,<br>
A holy nation, called from darkness for good,<br>
To declare His praises, His marvelous light,<br>
Once not a people, now His own delight.
        </div>

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
Christ suffered for you, leaving you a path to trace,<br>
He bore no sin, no deceit upon His face,<br>
When they hurled insults, He did not retaliate,<br>
By His wounds you're healed, returned from wandering fate.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

(Devotional Ballad, Emotional, Orchestral, Reverent)

[Verse 1]
Put away all malice, deceit, and envy's sting,
Like newborn babes, long for the pure milk the Word brings,
Come to Him, the living Stone rejected by men,
But chosen and precious in God's sight again.
You also, like living stones, are being built,
A spiritual house where holy prayers are spilt.

[Chorus]
You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,
A holy nation, called from darkness for good,
To declare His praises, His marvelous light,
Once not a people, now His own delight.

[Verse 2]
Abstain from fleshly passions that wage war within,
Keep conduct honorable so the lost may win,
Submit to every human authority in place,
Silence foolish people through your quiet grace.
Live as servants of God, free yet bound by love,
Honor everyone, fear God who reigns above.

[Chorus]
You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,
A holy nation, called from darkness for good,
To declare His praises, His marvelous light,
Once not a people, now His own delight.

[Bridge]
Christ suffered for you, leaving you a path to trace,
He bore no sin, no deceit upon His face,
When they hurled insults, He did not retaliate,
By His wounds you're healed, returned from wandering fate.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
