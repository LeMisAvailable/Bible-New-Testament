        <div class="verse">
In Iconium they spoke with power,<br>
Jews and Greeks believed that hour,<br>
But the city split in two,<br>
Some with apostles, some withdrew.<br>
When they learned of plots of stone,<br>
They fled to cities yet unknown,<br>
Lystra, Derbe, preaching still,<br>
Nothing could break their iron will.

"We are only men like you,<br>
Turn from idols, something new,<br>
To the living God who made,<br>

Through many tribulations we must go,<br>
To enter the kingdom—this we know,<br>
Strengthening souls along the way,<br>
Encouraging them to keep the faith each day.

        <div class="verse">
In Lystra, Paul healed a man lame from birth,<br>
The crowds cried out across the earth,<br>

They brought oxen, garlands to adorn.<br>
Paul and Barnabas tore their clothes,<br>
"We're mortals too!" their passion rose,<br>
But Jews from Antioch stirred the crowd,<br>
They stoned Paul, left him in death's shroud.

(Devotional Ballad, Emotional, Orchestral, Reverent)

[Verse 1]
In Iconium they spoke with power,
Jews and Greeks believed that hour,
But the city split in two,
Some with apostles, some withdrew.
When they learned of plots of stone,
They fled to cities yet unknown,
Lystra, Derbe, preaching still,
Nothing could break their iron will.

[Chorus]
"We are only men like you,
Turn from idols, something new,
To the living God who made,
Heaven, earth, and all displayed."
Through many tribulations we must go,
To enter the kingdom—this we know,
Strengthening souls along the way,
Encouraging them to keep the faith each day.

[Verse 2]
In Lystra, Paul healed a man lame from birth,
The crowds cried out across the earth,
"The gods have come in human form!"
They brought oxen, garlands to adorn.
Paul and Barnabas tore their clothes,
"We're mortals too!" their passion rose,
But Jews from Antioch stirred the crowd,
They stoned Paul, left him in death's shroud.

[Chorus]
"We are only men like you,
Turn from idols, something new,
To the living God who made,
Heaven, earth, and all displayed."
Through many tribulations we must go,
To enter the kingdom—this we know,
Strengthening souls along the way,
Encouraging them to keep the faith each day.

[Bridge]
But Paul rose up and walked back in,
The next day journeyed on again,
Appointing elders, church by church,
They left no soul without a perch.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
