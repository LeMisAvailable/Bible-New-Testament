        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
I charge you in the presence of the Lord,<br>
Preach the Word, in season and deplored,<br>
Reprove, rebuke, exhort with patience true,<br>
Teaching sound doctrine in all that you do.<br>
For the time is coming when they won't endure,<br>
Sound teaching—they'll want fables to obscure.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
I have fought the good fight, I've finished the race,<br>
I have kept the faith through trials I faced,<br>
Now the crown of righteousness waits for me,<br>
And for all who long for His appearing to see.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Be sober-minded, endure the suffering here,<br>
Do the work of an evangelist without fear,<br>
Fulfill your ministry to the very end,<br>
For I am already being poured out, my friend.<br>
The time of my departure has now come,<br>
But the Lord stood by me—I am not undone.

I have kept the faith through trials I faced,<br>
Now the crown of righteousness waits for me,<br>
And for all who long for His appearing to see.

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
The Lord will rescue me from every deed,<br>
And bring me safe to His kingdom—He will lead,<br>
To Him be glory forever and ever, amen,<br>
Until we meet in His presence again.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
I charge you in the presence of the Lord,
Preach the Word, in season and deplored,
Reprove, rebuke, exhort with patience true,
Teaching sound doctrine in all that you do.
For the time is coming when they won't endure,
Sound teaching—they'll want fables to obscure.

[Chorus]
I have fought the good fight, I've finished the race,
I have kept the faith through trials I faced,
Now the crown of righteousness waits for me,
And for all who long for His appearing to see.

[Verse 2]
Be sober-minded, endure the suffering here,
Do the work of an evangelist without fear,
Fulfill your ministry to the very end,
For I am already being poured out, my friend.
The time of my departure has now come,
But the Lord stood by me—I am not undone.

[Chorus]
I have fought the good fight, I've finished the race,
I have kept the faith through trials I faced,
Now the crown of righteousness waits for me,
And for all who long for His appearing to see.

[Bridge]
The Lord will rescue me from every deed,
And bring me safe to His kingdom—He will lead,
To Him be glory forever and ever, amen,
Until we meet in His presence again.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
