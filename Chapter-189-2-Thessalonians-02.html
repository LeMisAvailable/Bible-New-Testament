        <p class="subtitle">2 Thessalonians Chapter 2</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Concerning the coming of our Lord that day,<br>
Do not be shaken, do not be led astray,<br>
By spirit or word or letter claiming our name,<br>
The day has not come—resist the enemy's claim.<br>
First the rebellion, the falling away,<br>
The man of lawlessness will have his day.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
Stand firm and hold to what you have been taught,<br>
The traditions we delivered cannot be bought,<br>
The Lord will slay him with the breath of His mouth,<br>
His coming will destroy from north to south.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
He exalts himself above all that is divine,<br>
Takes his seat in the temple, claiming what's not his shrine,<br>
With signs and wonders wrought by Satan's power,<br>
Deceiving those who perish in that hour.<br>
But God chose you from the beginning to be saved,<br>
Through sanctifying Spirit, truth engraved.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
May our Lord Jesus Christ Himself give comfort here,<br>
Our Father who loved us, drawing ever near,<br>
Eternal comfort, hope that never dies,<br>
Establish every heart that to Him cries.

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
Concerning the coming of our Lord that day,
Do not be shaken, do not be led astray,
By spirit or word or letter claiming our name,
The day has not come—resist the enemy's claim.
First the rebellion, the falling away,
The man of lawlessness will have his day.

[Chorus]
Stand firm and hold to what you have been taught,
The traditions we delivered cannot be bought,
The Lord will slay him with the breath of His mouth,
His coming will destroy from north to south.

[Verse 2]
He exalts himself above all that is divine,
Takes his seat in the temple, claiming what's not his shrine,
With signs and wonders wrought by Satan's power,
Deceiving those who perish in that hour.
But God chose you from the beginning to be saved,
Through sanctifying Spirit, truth engraved.

[Chorus]
Stand firm and hold to what you have been taught,
The traditions we delivered cannot be bought,
The Lord will slay him with the breath of His mouth,
His coming will destroy from north to south.

[Bridge]
May our Lord Jesus Christ Himself give comfort here,
Our Father who loved us, drawing ever near,
Eternal comfort, hope that never dies,
Establish every heart that to Him cries.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
