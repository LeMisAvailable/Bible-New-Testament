        <h1>More Than Enough</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Luke Chapter 9 - Feeding 5000 and Transfiguration</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Five thousand souls with hunger deep,<br>
Just five loaves and two fish to keep,<br>
"You give them something," Jesus said,<br>
He blessed and broke and they were fed.<br>
Twelve baskets full of leftover grace,<br>
Abundance flows from His embrace.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
He is more than enough for every need,<br>
In His hands, the small becomes the seed,<br>
Take up your cross and follow where He leads,<br>
He is more than enough indeed.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Upon the mountain, glory blazed,<br>
Moses and Elijah, voices raised,<br>
His face shone bright, His clothes like light,<br>
Peter, James, and John beheld the sight.<br>
"This is My Son," the Father's voice,<br>
"Listen to Him," make Him your choice.

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
Whoever wants to save their life will lose,<br>
But lose it for My sake, you cannot lose,<br>
What does it profit to gain the world entire,<br>
Yet forfeit your soul to empty desire?
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
Five thousand souls with hunger deep,
Just five loaves and two fish to keep,
"You give them something," Jesus said,
He blessed and broke and they were fed.
Twelve baskets full of leftover grace,
Abundance flows from His embrace.

[Chorus]
He is more than enough for every need,
In His hands, the small becomes the seed,
Take up your cross and follow where He leads,
He is more than enough indeed.

[Verse 2]
Upon the mountain, glory blazed,
Moses and Elijah, voices raised,
His face shone bright, His clothes like light,
Peter, James, and John beheld the sight.
"This is My Son," the Father's voice,
"Listen to Him," make Him your choice.

[Chorus]
He is more than enough for every need,
In His hands, the small becomes the seed,
Take up your cross and follow where He leads,
He is more than enough indeed.

[Bridge]
Whoever wants to save their life will lose,
But lose it for My sake, you cannot lose,
What does it profit to gain the world entire,
Yet forfeit your soul to empty desire?

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
