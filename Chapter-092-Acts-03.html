At the gate called Beautiful he lay,<br>
A man who'd never walked a single mile,<br>

[Verse 1]
At the gate called Beautiful he lay,
A man who'd never walked a single mile,
Begging for coins day after day,
His eyes had long forgotten how to smile.
Peter and John were passing by,
He reached his hand expecting gold,
But Peter caught his weary eye,
And spoke words that would never grow old.

[Chorus]
Silver and gold I do not have,
But what I have I give to you—
In the name of Jesus Christ, arise!
Stand on your feet and walk anew.
The power that raised Him from the grave,
Now flows through hands that heal and save,
Leap for joy, your chains are gone,
In Jesus' name, the victory's won.

[Verse 2]
He leaped up, walking, praising God,
The temple courts erupted with surprise,
This man they'd seen for years downtrod,
Now dancing with the wonder in his eyes.
Peter proclaimed to all the crowd,
"Why do you stare as if we did this deed?
The God of Abraham has made him proud,
Through faith in Jesus, he's been freed."

[Chorus]
Silver and gold I do not have,
But what I have I give to you—
In the name of Jesus Christ, arise!
Stand on your feet and walk anew.
The power that raised Him from the grave,
Now flows through hands that heal and save,
Leap for joy, your chains are gone,
In Jesus' name, the victory's won.

[Bridge]
Repent and turn, receive His grace,
Times of refreshing from His throne,
One day He'll come to take His place,
And gather all who are His own.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
