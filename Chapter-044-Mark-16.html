At dawn the women came with spice,<br>
Their hearts prepared for sacrifice,<br>
But who will roll the stone away?<br>

To Mary Magdalene He first appeared,<br>
She ran to tell, though some hearts feared,<br>
Then to two walking on the road,<br>
And to the eleven where they abode.<br>
"Go into all the world," He said,<br>
"Preach the gospel, raise the dead."

Signs will follow those who believe,<br>
In His name, the sick receive,<br>
He ascended to His throne on high,<br>
Now seated at the Father's side.

You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
At dawn the women came with spice,
Their hearts prepared for sacrifice,
But who will roll the stone away?
They wondered on that holy day.
An angel dressed in white was there,
"He is not here—He's risen! Declare!"

[Chorus]
He is risen! He's alive!
Death could not hold Him, we survive,
Go and tell the world this news,
Christ has conquered—we can't lose,
He is risen! He's alive!

[Verse 2]
To Mary Magdalene He first appeared,
She ran to tell, though some hearts feared,
Then to two walking on the road,
And to the eleven where they abode.
"Go into all the world," He said,
"Preach the gospel, raise the dead."

[Chorus]
He is risen! He's alive!
Death could not hold Him, we survive,
Go and tell the world this news,
Christ has conquered—we can't lose,
He is risen! He's alive!

[Bridge]
Signs will follow those who believe,
In His name, the sick receive,
He ascended to His throne on high,
Now seated at the Father's side.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
