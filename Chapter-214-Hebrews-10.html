        <p class="subtitle">Hebrews Chapter 10</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Powerful Worship Anthem</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
The law was just a shadow of good things to come,<br>
The same sacrifices repeated, never done,<br>
Year after year they offered blood again,<br>
But bulls and goats could never cleanse the stain.<br>
A body You prepared for Me, Christ said,<br>
"I have come to do Your will instead."
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
Once for all, He offered up His life,<br>
Once for all, He ended all the strife,<br>
By one sacrifice perfected for all time,<br>
Those being sanctified, made wholly divine.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Where sins have been forgiven once and true,<br>
There is no longer offering left to do,<br>
So brothers, sisters, we have confidence now,<br>
To enter the holy place, before God we bow.<br>
Through the curtain, that is through His flesh,<br>
A new and living way, our hearts refresh.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>

Once for all, He offered up His life,<br>
Once for all, He ended all the strife,<br>
By one sacrifice perfected for all time,<br>
Those being sanctified, made wholly divine.
        </div>

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
Let us hold unswervingly to hope we profess,<br>
For He who promised is faithful, nonetheless,<br>
Spur one another on to love and deeds so good,<br>
Do not give up meeting, as some have understood.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
The law was just a shadow of good things to come,
The same sacrifices repeated, never done,
Year after year they offered blood again,
But bulls and goats could never cleanse the stain.
A body You prepared for Me, Christ said,
"I have come to do Your will instead."

[Chorus]
Once for all, He offered up His life,
Once for all, He ended all the strife,
By one sacrifice perfected for all time,
Those being sanctified, made wholly divine.

[Verse 2]
Where sins have been forgiven once and true,
There is no longer offering left to do,
So brothers, sisters, we have confidence now,
To enter the holy place, before God we bow.
Through the curtain, that is through His flesh,
A new and living way, our hearts refresh.

[Chorus]
Once for all, He offered up His life,
Once for all, He ended all the strife,
By one sacrifice perfected for all time,
Those being sanctified, made wholly divine.

[Bridge]
Let us hold unswervingly to hope we profess,
For He who promised is faithful, nonetheless,
Spur one another on to love and deeds so good,
Do not give up meeting, as some have understood.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
