        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Zacchaeus climbed the sycamore tree,<br>
A wealthy man who longed to see,<br>
The One they called the Son of Man,<br>
Too short to see, he made a plan.<br>
Jesus stopped and looked above,<br>
"Come down, today I'll share My love."

Salvation has come to this house today,<br>
The lost are found, the debts are paid,<br>
The Son of Man came to seek and save,<br>
All who were lost, all who were slaves.<br>
No one's too far, no one's too small,<br>
When Jesus comes, He comes for all.

        <div class="verse">
Half of all I own I'll give,<br>
To the poor, that they may live,<br>
And anyone I've cheated blind,<br>
Four times over they will find.<br>
This son of Abraham was lost,<br>
But Jesus paid the highest cost.

Hosanna! Blessed is the King!<br>
The stones would cry if we don't sing,<br>
He wept for Jerusalem's fate,<br>
"If you had known before too late."<br>
The temple cleansed, His Father's house,<br>
A den of thieves, He drove them out.

You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>

Your faithful heart I understand.

(Devotional Ballad, Emotional, Orchestral, Reverent)

[Verse 1]
Zacchaeus climbed the sycamore tree,
A wealthy man who longed to see,
The One they called the Son of Man,
Too short to see, he made a plan.
Jesus stopped and looked above,
"Come down, today I'll share My love."

[Chorus]
Salvation has come to this house today,
The lost are found, the debts are paid,
The Son of Man came to seek and save,
All who were lost, all who were slaves.
No one's too far, no one's too small,
When Jesus comes, He comes for all.

[Verse 2]
Half of all I own I'll give,
To the poor, that they may live,
And anyone I've cheated blind,
Four times over they will find.
This son of Abraham was lost,
But Jesus paid the highest cost.

[Chorus]
Salvation has come to this house today,
The lost are found, the debts are paid,
The Son of Man came to seek and save,
All who were lost, all who were slaves.
No one's too far, no one's too small,
When Jesus comes, He comes for all.

[Bridge]
Hosanna! Blessed is the King!
The stones would cry if we don't sing,
He wept for Jerusalem's fate,
"If you had known before too late."
The temple cleansed, His Father's house,
A den of thieves, He drove them out.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
