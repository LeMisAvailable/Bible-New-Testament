        <p class="subtitle">Revelation Chapter 9</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Dark Orchestral Epic</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
The fifth trumpet sounded, a star fell from the sky,<br>
Given the key to the Abyss, smoke rose up on high,<br>
Locusts came like armies with the sting of scorpions,<br>
Tormenting those unmarked for five long months of pain.<br>
Their king was Abaddon, Destroyer was his name,<br>
The first woe passed but two more woes remain.

        <div class="chorus">
Even in the darkness, Your light breaks through,<br>
When the world is shaking, we hold onto You,<br>
Trumpets sound the warning, time is running thin,<br>
Turn away from idols, let Your grace begin.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
The sixth trumpet released four angels at the river's tide,<br>
Bound at the Euphrates, now unleashed to ride,<br>
Two hundred million horsemen with fire, smoke, and stone,<br>
A third of mankind fell beneath judgment's throne.<br>
Yet those who lived refused to turn from their wicked ways,<br>
Still worshiping their idols through those darkened days.

        <div class="bridge">
They would not repent of murders or their sorcery,<br>
Their immorality or theft—they would not bend the knee,<br>
But still the Lord extends His hand to those who hear His call,<br>
Even now His mercy waits to catch us when we fall.

When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

(Dark Orchestral Epic, Dramatic, Intense, Powerful)

[Verse 1]
The fifth trumpet sounded, a star fell from the sky,
Given the key to the Abyss, smoke rose up on high,
Locusts came like armies with the sting of scorpions,
Tormenting those unmarked for five long months of pain.
Their king was Abaddon, Destroyer was his name,
The first woe passed but two more woes remain.

[Chorus]
Even in the darkness, Your light breaks through,
When the world is shaking, we hold onto You,
Trumpets sound the warning, time is running thin,
Turn away from idols, let Your grace begin.

[Verse 2]
The sixth trumpet released four angels at the river's tide,
Bound at the Euphrates, now unleashed to ride,
Two hundred million horsemen with fire, smoke, and stone,
A third of mankind fell beneath judgment's throne.
Yet those who lived refused to turn from their wicked ways,
Still worshiping their idols through those darkened days.

[Chorus]
Even in the darkness, Your light breaks through,
When the world is shaking, we hold onto You,
Trumpets sound the warning, time is running thin,
Turn away from idols, let Your grace begin.

[Bridge]
They would not repent of murders or their sorcery,
Their immorality or theft—they would not bend the knee,
But still the Lord extends His hand to those who hear His call,
Even now His mercy waits to catch us when we fall.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
