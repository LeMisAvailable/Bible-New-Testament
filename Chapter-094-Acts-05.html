Ananias and Sapphira made a vow,<br>
Sold their land but kept a portion back somehow,<br>
They laid their gift at the apostles' feet,<br>
But their deception made their offering incomplete.<br>
Peter saw through to the darkened heart,<br>
"Why has Satan torn your soul apart?<br>
You lied not just to men but to the Lord,"<br>
And judgment came, swift as a sword.

Even Peter's shadow brought them hope,<br>
The Spirit's power had endless scope.

[Verse 1]
Ananias and Sapphira made a vow,
Sold their land but kept a portion back somehow,
They laid their gift at the apostles' feet,
But their deception made their offering incomplete.
Peter saw through to the darkened heart,
"Why has Satan torn your soul apart?
You lied not just to men but to the Lord,"
And judgment came, swift as a sword.

[Chorus]
God sees the heart, the hidden places,
Nothing escapes His holy gaze,
Great fear fell upon the church that day,
Teaching us to walk in holy ways.
Yet still the apostles healed the sick,
Multitudes believed and came so quick,
Even Peter's shadow brought them hope,
The Spirit's power had endless scope.

[Verse 2]
The high priest burned with jealousy,
Threw the apostles into custody,
But an angel opened prison doors by night,
"Go stand in the temple, speak words of life."
When the council sent to bring them in,
The cells were empty—where had they been?
"We must obey God rather than men,"
Peter declared again and again.

[Chorus]
God sees the heart, the hidden places,
Nothing escapes His holy gaze,
Great fear fell upon the church that day,
Teaching us to walk in holy ways.
Yet still the apostles healed the sick,
Multitudes believed and came so quick,
Even Peter's shadow brought them hope,
The Spirit's power had endless scope.

[Bridge]
Gamaliel spoke wisdom to the hall,
"If this is from God, you cannot make it fall,
But if from men, it will fade away,
Be careful not to fight God this day."

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Lord, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
