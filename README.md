Welcome to the New Testament Bible Songs collection — a creative journey through Scripture set to music.

All 260 chapters of the New Testament have been transformed into original songs, capturing the key themes, stories, and teachings in lyrical form that speaks to the heart.

Designed especially for teenagers, these songs make the Bible accessible, memorable, and deeply engaging for a new generation.

Every song follows a consistent structure — verses, chorus, bridge, and a unifying outro that ties the entire collection together with this reminder:

"When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand."
Whether for personal devotion, youth group study, or family worship, these songs bring the New Testament to life in a fresh and powerful way.
