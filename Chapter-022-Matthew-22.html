        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
A king prepared a wedding for his son,<br>
Invitations sent, but guests refused to come,<br>
So he sent servants to the streets and roads,<br>
Gathered the poor, lifted their heavy loads.<br>
But one came in without the wedding dress,<br>
Cast into darkness—don't ignore the test.

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
Many are called, but few are chosen still,<br>
Accept the invitation, follow His will,<br>
Love the Lord your God with all your heart,<br>
Love your neighbor too—that's where life starts.

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
They tried to trap Him with taxes and law,<br>
"Give to Caesar what is his," they saw,<br>
"And give to God what belongs to God alone,"<br>
His wisdom silenced every bitter tone.<br>
Sadducees questioned resurrection's day,<br>
"God of the living," Jesus showed the way.

        <div class="bridge">
"What is the greatest commandment?" they asked,<br>
Jesus answered with a love unsurpassed,<br>
"Whose Son is the Christ?"—they couldn't reply,<br>
From that day on, none dared to try.

When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>

Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
A king prepared a wedding for his son,
Invitations sent, but guests refused to come,
So he sent servants to the streets and roads,
Gathered the poor, lifted their heavy loads.
But one came in without the wedding dress,
Cast into darkness—don't ignore the test.

[Chorus]
Many are called, but few are chosen still,
Accept the invitation, follow His will,
Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
Love your neighbor too—that's where life starts.

[Verse 2]
They tried to trap Him with taxes and law,
"Give to Caesar what is his," they saw,
"And give to God what belongs to God alone,"
His wisdom silenced every bitter tone.
Sadducees questioned resurrection's day,
"God of the living," Jesus showed the way.

[Chorus]
Many are called, but few are chosen still,
Accept the invitation, follow His will,
Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
Love your neighbor too—that's where life starts.

[Bridge]
"What is the greatest commandment?" they asked,
Jesus answered with a love unsurpassed,
"Whose Son is the Christ?"—they couldn't reply,
From that day on, none dared to try.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
