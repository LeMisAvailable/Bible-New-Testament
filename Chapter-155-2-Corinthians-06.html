        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Now is the day of salvation, hear His voice,<br>
Now is the time for making that choice,<br>
We put no stumbling block in anyone's way,<br>
That the ministry may be honored each day.<br>
Through hardships, troubles, sleepless nights,<br>
We serve with purity, walking in light.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
Do not be yoked with those who don't believe,<br>
What fellowship has light with darkness to weave?<br>
Come out from them and be set apart,<br>
Touch nothing unclean, give God your whole heart,<br>
He will be our Father, we His sons and daughters.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
In beatings and prisons, in riots and toil,<br>
With patience and kindness that nothing can spoil,<br>
In genuine love and the power of God,<br>
With weapons of righteousness, the path Jesus trod.<br>
Sorrowful yet rejoicing, poor yet making rich,<br>
Having nothing, possessing everything in His grip.

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>

Do not be yoked with those who don't believe,<br>

        <div class="bridge">
You are the temple of the living God,<br>
He dwells within you, amazing and odd,<br>
That the Creator of stars and sea,<br>
Would choose to make His home in you and me.

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
Now is the day of salvation, hear His voice,
Now is the time for making that choice,
We put no stumbling block in anyone's way,
That the ministry may be honored each day.
Through hardships, troubles, sleepless nights,
We serve with purity, walking in light.

[Chorus]
Do not be yoked with those who don't believe,
What fellowship has light with darkness to weave?
Come out from them and be set apart,
Touch nothing unclean, give God your whole heart,
He will be our Father, we His sons and daughters.

[Verse 2]
In beatings and prisons, in riots and toil,
With patience and kindness that nothing can spoil,
In genuine love and the power of God,
With weapons of righteousness, the path Jesus trod.
Sorrowful yet rejoicing, poor yet making rich,
Having nothing, possessing everything in His grip.

[Chorus]
Do not be yoked with those who don't believe,
What fellowship has light with darkness to weave?
Come out from them and be set apart,
Touch nothing unclean, give God your whole heart,
He will be our Father, we His sons and daughters.

[Bridge]
You are the temple of the living God,
He dwells within you, amazing and odd,
That the Creator of stars and sea,
Would choose to make His home in you and me.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
