        <p class="subtitle">Hebrews Chapter 11</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Epic Inspirational Anthem</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Now faith is confidence in what we hope to see,<br>
Assurance of the unseen reality,<br>
By faith we understand the worlds were formed by Word,<br>
What is seen was made from what cannot be heard.<br>
Abel offered better, Enoch walked with God,<br>
Noah built an ark on dry and dusty sod.

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
By faith they conquered kingdoms, shut the lions' mouths,<br>
By faith they faced the fire, believing without doubts,<br>
The world was not worthy of these souls so brave,<br>
By faith they're still speaking from beyond the grave.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Abraham obeyed and went, not knowing where,<br>
He lived in tents, a stranger everywhere,<br>
Looking for a city built by God's own hand,<br>
Sarah received power though beyond her span.<br>
Isaac blessed his sons, and Jacob blessed the twelve,<br>
Joseph spoke of exodus, in faith he delved.

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
Moses chose affliction over Egypt's throne,<br>
Rahab welcomed spies, her faith was clearly shown,<br>
Time would fail to tell of Gideon and Barak too,<br>
David and the prophets, faithful through and through.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
Now faith is confidence in what we hope to see,
Assurance of the unseen reality,
By faith we understand the worlds were formed by Word,
What is seen was made from what cannot be heard.
Abel offered better, Enoch walked with God,
Noah built an ark on dry and dusty sod.

[Chorus]
By faith they conquered kingdoms, shut the lions' mouths,
By faith they faced the fire, believing without doubts,
The world was not worthy of these souls so brave,
By faith they're still speaking from beyond the grave.

[Verse 2]
Abraham obeyed and went, not knowing where,
He lived in tents, a stranger everywhere,
Looking for a city built by God's own hand,
Sarah received power though beyond her span.
Isaac blessed his sons, and Jacob blessed the twelve,
Joseph spoke of exodus, in faith he delved.

[Chorus]
By faith they conquered kingdoms, shut the lions' mouths,
By faith they faced the fire, believing without doubts,
The world was not worthy of these souls so brave,
By faith they're still speaking from beyond the grave.

[Bridge]
Moses chose affliction over Egypt's throne,
Rahab welcomed spies, her faith was clearly shown,
Time would fail to tell of Gideon and Barak too,
David and the prophets, faithful through and through.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
