        <h1>The Day of the Lord</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">2 Peter Chapter 3</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
Scoffers will come in the last days mocking,<br>
"Where is the promise of His coming?" they're talking,<br>
They forget that by the Word the heavens were made,<br>
And by water the world was flooded and weighed.<br>
The present heavens and earth are stored for fire,<br>
Kept until judgment day, drawn ever higher.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
A day with the Lord is like a thousand years,<br>
A thousand years like one day through the tears,<br>
He's not slow concerning His promise true,<br>
He's patient, not wanting to lose any of you.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
The day of the Lord will come like a thief at night,<br>
The heavens will pass with a roar, burning bright,<br>
The elements melt with fervent heat's embrace,<br>
The earth and its works will be laid bare in space.<br>
What kind of people ought you then to be?<br>
Living holy lives in expectancy.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
A day with the Lord is like a thousand years,<br>
A thousand years like one day through the tears,<br>
He's not slow concerning His promise true,<br>
He's patient, not wanting to lose any of you.
        </div>

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
We await new heavens and a new earth bright,<br>
Where righteousness dwells in eternal light,<br>
Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord,<br>
To Him be glory now and evermore.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
Scoffers will come in the last days mocking,
"Where is the promise of His coming?" they're talking,
They forget that by the Word the heavens were made,
And by water the world was flooded and weighed.
The present heavens and earth are stored for fire,
Kept until judgment day, drawn ever higher.

[Chorus]
A day with the Lord is like a thousand years,
A thousand years like one day through the tears,
He's not slow concerning His promise true,
He's patient, not wanting to lose any of you.

[Verse 2]
The day of the Lord will come like a thief at night,
The heavens will pass with a roar, burning bright,
The elements melt with fervent heat's embrace,
The earth and its works will be laid bare in space.
What kind of people ought you then to be?
Living holy lives in expectancy.

[Chorus]
A day with the Lord is like a thousand years,
A thousand years like one day through the tears,
He's not slow concerning His promise true,
He's patient, not wanting to lose any of you.

[Bridge]
We await new heavens and a new earth bright,
Where righteousness dwells in eternal light,
Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord,
To Him be glory now and evermore.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
