        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Triumphant Worship Anthem</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
A scroll sealed with seven seals in heaven's hand,<br>
Who is worthy to open, who can understand?<br>
John wept for no one could be found to break the seal,<br>
But an elder spoke, "The Lion of Judah is real."<br>
Then he saw a Lamb as though it had been slain,<br>
Standing at the throne to break death's heavy chain.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,<br>
To receive all power and glory and fame,<br>
With His blood He purchased us for God,<br>
Every tribe and tongue now lift their song abroad.

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
The Lamb took the scroll from the One upon the throne,<br>
And the creatures and the elders fell before Him prone,<br>
Golden bowls of incense, prayers of saints arose,<br>
A new song erupted that all of heaven knows.<br>
"You were slain, and by Your blood You set us free,<br>
Made us kings and priests for all eternity."

Ten thousand times ten thousand voices ring,<br>
Wisdom, strength, and honor to our King,<br>
Every creature heaven, earth, and sea,<br>
Praise the Lamb for all eternity.

Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
A scroll sealed with seven seals in heaven's hand,
Who is worthy to open, who can understand?
John wept for no one could be found to break the seal,
But an elder spoke, "The Lion of Judah is real."
Then he saw a Lamb as though it had been slain,
Standing at the throne to break death's heavy chain.

[Chorus]
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,
To receive all power and glory and fame,
With His blood He purchased us for God,
Every tribe and tongue now lift their song abroad.

[Verse 2]
The Lamb took the scroll from the One upon the throne,
And the creatures and the elders fell before Him prone,
Golden bowls of incense, prayers of saints arose,
A new song erupted that all of heaven knows.
"You were slain, and by Your blood You set us free,
Made us kings and priests for all eternity."

[Chorus]
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,
To receive all power and glory and fame,
With His blood He purchased us for God,
Every tribe and tongue now lift their song abroad.

[Bridge]
Ten thousand times ten thousand voices ring,
Wisdom, strength, and honor to our King,
Every creature heaven, earth, and sea,
Praise the Lamb for all eternity.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
