Fourteen years I went to Jerusalem,<br>

For fear of men he pulled away,<br>

If righteousness came through the law,<br>
Then Christ died for nothing at all.

[Verse 1]
Fourteen years I went to Jerusalem,
To share the gospel given to them,
James and Peter, John reached out their hand,
Together for the truth we stand.
They added nothing to what I preached,
The grace of God to all was reached.

[Chorus]
I have been crucified with Christ,
No longer I, but He who gave His life,
The Son of God who loved me, died for me,
Now Christ lives in me, and I am free.

[Verse 2]
When Peter came to Antioch's shore,
I stood against him, truth to restore,
For fear of men he pulled away,
But grace and law cannot both stay.
If righteousness came through the law,
Then Christ died for nothing at all.

[Chorus]
I have been crucified with Christ,
No longer I, but He who gave His life,
The Son of God who loved me, died for me,
Now Christ lives in me, and I am free.

[Bridge]
Not by works but by faith alone,
We're justified before His throne,
The life I live within this frame,
I live by faith in Jesus' name.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
