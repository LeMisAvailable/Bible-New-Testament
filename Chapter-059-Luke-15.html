        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
One sheep was lost among the hills,<br>
The shepherd searched through darkened fields,<br>
Ninety-nine were safe at home,<br>
But love refused to leave one alone.<br>
A single coin beneath the dust,<br>
She swept until she found her trust.

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
There is joy in heaven tonight,<br>
Over one soul returning to the light,<br>
The Father runs with open arms so wide,<br>
For the lost one found, for the child who cried.<br>
Once was dead but now alive,<br>
In the Father's love, we survive.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
A younger son demanded all,<br>
Then squandered it before his fall,<br>
In a distant land with pigs he lay,<br>
Remembering his father's way.<br>
"I'll return and be a slave,"<br>
Not knowing mercy's coming wave.
        </div>

In the Father's love, we survive.

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
The robe, the ring, the sandals new,<br>
The fatted calf prepared for you,<br>
The elder son could not understand,<br>
Why grace was given by the Father's hand.<br>
But all I have is yours, my son,<br>
Rejoice—your brother's life is won.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>

When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
One sheep was lost among the hills,
The shepherd searched through darkened fields,
Ninety-nine were safe at home,
But love refused to leave one alone.
A single coin beneath the dust,
She swept until she found her trust.

[Chorus]
There is joy in heaven tonight,
Over one soul returning to the light,
The Father runs with open arms so wide,
For the lost one found, for the child who cried.
Once was dead but now alive,
In the Father's love, we survive.

[Verse 2]
A younger son demanded all,
Then squandered it before his fall,
In a distant land with pigs he lay,
Remembering his father's way.
"I'll return and be a slave,"
Not knowing mercy's coming wave.

[Chorus]
There is joy in heaven tonight,
Over one soul returning to the light,
The Father runs with open arms so wide,
For the lost one found, for the child who cried.
Once was dead but now alive,
In the Father's love, we survive.

[Bridge]
The robe, the ring, the sandals new,
The fatted calf prepared for you,
The elder son could not understand,
Why grace was given by the Father's hand.
But all I have is yours, my son,
Rejoice—your brother's life is won.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
