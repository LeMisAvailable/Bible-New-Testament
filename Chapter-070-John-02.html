[Verse 1]
At Cana's feast the wine ran dry,
Mary turned with knowing eye,
"Whatever He says, just obey,"
She trusted Him to find a way.
Six stone jars stood empty, cold,
But Jesus turned them into gold.

[Chorus]
He transforms the ordinary,
Into something extraordinary,
From empty vessels, new wine flows,
His glory through the miracle shows.

[Verse 2]
Then to the temple courts He came,
Burning with a holy flame,
"My Father's house is not for trade,"
With righteous fire, the tables swayed.
"Destroy this temple," hear Him say,
"In three days I'll raise it up to stay."

[Chorus]
He transforms the ordinary,
Into something extraordinary,
From empty vessels, new wine flows,
His glory through the miracle shows.

[Bridge]
He knew what was in every heart,
No need for man to play a part,
The first of signs to show His power,
Disciples believed in that hour.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
