        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Power Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
In ancient days through prophets old,<br>
God spoke His truth, His love foretold,<br>
But now at last in these final days,<br>
He speaks through His Son in glorious ways.<br>
The radiance of glory, the image divine,<br>
Sustaining all worlds by power sublime.

        <div class="chorus">
Higher than the angels, brighter than the sun,<br>
The name above all names belongs to the Son,<br>
They worship at His footstool, bow before His throne,<br>
Jesus reigns forever, matchless and alone.

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
To which of the angels did God ever say,<br>
"You are My Son, begotten this day"?<br>
The firstborn of heaven, the heir of all things,<br>
While angels serve those salvation brings.<br>
His throne lasts forever, His scepter is right,<br>
Anointed with joy, clothed in pure light.

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
The heavens will perish, they'll fade like a robe,<br>
But You remain constant across every globe,<br>
Unchanging, eternal, the same yesterday,<br>
Your years never ending, You light up the way.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
In ancient days through prophets old,
God spoke His truth, His love foretold,
But now at last in these final days,
He speaks through His Son in glorious ways.
The radiance of glory, the image divine,
Sustaining all worlds by power sublime.

[Chorus]
Higher than the angels, brighter than the sun,
The name above all names belongs to the Son,
They worship at His footstool, bow before His throne,
Jesus reigns forever, matchless and alone.

[Verse 2]
To which of the angels did God ever say,
"You are My Son, begotten this day"?
The firstborn of heaven, the heir of all things,
While angels serve those salvation brings.
His throne lasts forever, His scepter is right,
Anointed with joy, clothed in pure light.

[Chorus]
Higher than the angels, brighter than the sun,
The name above all names belongs to the Son,
They worship at His footstool, bow before His throne,
Jesus reigns forever, matchless and alone.

[Bridge]
The heavens will perish, they'll fade like a robe,
But You remain constant across every globe,
Unchanging, eternal, the same yesterday,
Your years never ending, You light up the way.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
