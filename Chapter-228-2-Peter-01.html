His divine power has granted all we need,<br>
For life and godliness, He's planted the seed,<br>
Through knowledge of Him who called us by His grace,<br>
Precious promises that lead us to His face.<br>
Partakers of the divine nature we become,<br>
Escaping corruption when victory is won.

Steadfastness and godliness that makes you whole,<br>
Brotherly affection crowned with love divine,<br>
Make your calling sure, let your light forever shine.

If these qualities are yours and multiplied,<br>
You'll never be unfruitful, standing by His side,<br>
But whoever lacks them is blind and cannot see,<br>
Forgetting that from sin they have been set free.<br>
Be diligent to confirm your calling true,<br>
You'll never stumble when He's walking you through.

On the holy mountain, His glory we could see,<br>
The prophetic Word confirmed like morning star,<br>
A lamp shining bright wherever you are.

Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
His divine power has granted all we need,
For life and godliness, He's planted the seed,
Through knowledge of Him who called us by His grace,
Precious promises that lead us to His face.
Partakers of the divine nature we become,
Escaping corruption when victory is won.

[Chorus]
Add to your faith virtue, knowledge, and control,
Steadfastness and godliness that makes you whole,
Brotherly affection crowned with love divine,
Make your calling sure, let your light forever shine.

[Verse 2]
If these qualities are yours and multiplied,
You'll never be unfruitful, standing by His side,
But whoever lacks them is blind and cannot see,
Forgetting that from sin they have been set free.
Be diligent to confirm your calling true,
You'll never stumble when He's walking you through.

[Chorus]
Add to your faith virtue, knowledge, and control,
Steadfastness and godliness that makes you whole,
Brotherly affection crowned with love divine,
Make your calling sure, let your light forever shine.

[Bridge]
We were eyewitnesses of His majesty,
On the holy mountain, His glory we could see,
The prophetic Word confirmed like morning star,
A lamp shining bright wherever you are.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
