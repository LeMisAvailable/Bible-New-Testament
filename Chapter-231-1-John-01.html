        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
That which was from the beginning, we have heard,<br>
We have seen with our eyes the living Word,<br>
Our hands have touched the Word of life so true,<br>
The eternal life revealed to me and you.<br>
We proclaim what we have seen and heard this day,<br>
That you may have fellowship along the way.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all,<br>
If we walk in the light, we'll never fall,<br>
The blood of Jesus cleanses every sin,<br>
Fellowship with one another begins within.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
If we say we have no sin, we deceive our soul,<br>
The truth is not in us, we're not made whole,<br>
But if we confess our sins, He's faithful still,<br>
Just to forgive and cleanse us by His will.<br>
If we say we've never sinned, we make Him a liar,<br>
His Word is not in us, we're in the mire.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all,<br>
If we walk in the light, we'll never fall,<br>
The blood of Jesus cleanses every sin,<br>
Fellowship with one another begins within.
        </div>

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
Our fellowship is with the Father above,<br>
And with His Son Jesus, wrapped in love,<br>
We write these things that your joy may be complete,<br>
Walking in the light makes life so sweet.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
That which was from the beginning, we have heard,
We have seen with our eyes the living Word,
Our hands have touched the Word of life so true,
The eternal life revealed to me and you.
We proclaim what we have seen and heard this day,
That you may have fellowship along the way.

[Chorus]
God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all,
If we walk in the light, we'll never fall,
The blood of Jesus cleanses every sin,
Fellowship with one another begins within.

[Verse 2]
If we say we have no sin, we deceive our soul,
The truth is not in us, we're not made whole,
But if we confess our sins, He's faithful still,
Just to forgive and cleanse us by His will.
If we say we've never sinned, we make Him a liar,
His Word is not in us, we're in the mire.

[Chorus]
God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all,
If we walk in the light, we'll never fall,
The blood of Jesus cleanses every sin,
Fellowship with one another begins within.

[Bridge]
Our fellowship is with the Father above,
And with His Son Jesus, wrapped in love,
We write these things that your joy may be complete,
Walking in the light makes life so sweet.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
