        <p class="subtitle">Acts Chapter 20</p>
        <p class="duration">Duration: ~2 minutes | Style: Devotional Ballad</p>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
On the first day they gathered to break bread,<br>
Paul spoke long through midnight hours ahead,<br>
Young Eutychus fell from the window high,<br>
They rushed below beneath the moonlit sky.<br>
Paul embraced him, life returned once more,<br>
Then continued teaching as before.
        </div>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <div class="chorus">
It is more blessed to give than to receive,<br>
Guard the flock that God has called you to lead,<br>
Tears will fall but faith will see us through,<br>
I commend you now to God so true.
        </div>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <div class="verse">
At Miletus Paul called the elders near,<br>
His farewell words were mixed with love and tears,<br>
"You know how I lived among you all,<br>
Serving humbly, heeding heaven's call.<br>
I did not shrink from telling what you need,<br>
Repentance toward God, in Christ believe."

        <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
        <div class="bridge">
Chains and suffering wait for me ahead,<br>
But I count my life as nothing instead,<br>
If only I may finish well my race,<br>
Testifying to His saving grace.
        </div>

        <h2>[Outro]</h2>
        <div class="finale">
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,<br>
You calm the storm inside my mind.<br>
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,<br>
Your faithful heart I understand.

[Verse 1]
On the first day they gathered to break bread,
Paul spoke long through midnight hours ahead,
Young Eutychus fell from the window high,
They rushed below beneath the moonlit sky.
Paul embraced him, life returned once more,
Then continued teaching as before.

[Chorus]
It is more blessed to give than to receive,
Guard the flock that God has called you to lead,
Tears will fall but faith will see us through,
I commend you now to God so true.

[Verse 2]
At Miletus Paul called the elders near,
His farewell words were mixed with love and tears,
"You know how I lived among you all,
Serving humbly, heeding heaven's call.
I did not shrink from telling what you need,
Repentance toward God, in Christ believe."

[Chorus]
It is more blessed to give than to receive,
Guard the flock that God has called you to lead,
Tears will fall but faith will see us through,
I commend you now to God so true.

[Bridge]
Chains and suffering wait for me ahead,
But I count my life as nothing instead,
If only I may finish well my race,
Testifying to His saving grace.

[Outro]
When fearful thoughts are intertwined,
You calm the storm inside my mind.
Jesus, though I cannot see Your hand,
Your faithful heart I understand.
